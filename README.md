# coupled_mott_oscillators
Code that simulates two stochastic coupled Mott oscillators 

The code uses the probability distribution P(V, t) for the resistive collapse of the Mott material under a voltage V and at time t that was derived in [R.Rocco et al, PRA 2022]. 
The code was used for providing support to the experimental results of a forthcoming scientific paper.
